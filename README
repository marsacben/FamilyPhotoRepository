For the image repository challenge I decided to create a family tree repository of images of my family (89 family members covering 6 generations) for whom you can search photos
through search filters for name, location, and date and look for ancestors and descendents of the name imputed into the filter (must use name filter to see descendents and ancestors).
When adding filter for descendents and ancestors this will also include pictures of the person whose descendents or ancestros for whom you are searching.
You must check the box of the search criteria of the text input you want to use (for example id you want to search for Emilio Sacristan Rock 
you must imput his name and then select the check box called Use Name Filter). 
If there are multiple pages of pictures, a next page button will appear in the lower left hand corner.
Data base is stored locally on my computer. To connect externally, it uses the IP address of my computer which may change and might cause problems.
